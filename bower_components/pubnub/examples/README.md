#### Simple Chat

Make sure to visit the Simple Chat App as a good starting places.

#### Dot Moving On Screen

This is a fun little dot tracker that is a shared resource between
multiple browser windows.
Try it with two separate browser windows.

#### Stalker

Stalker is pretty neat and also intrusive.
I recommend checking out this simple JS include.
What is does is it will allow you to **Follow** anyone
as they browse a website.
It shows you what they **SEE** as the **Scroll** and **Change Pages**.
